### INDENTATION
# Python unlike to the majority of programming languages, use the indentation to create block of code and not for have major readability

if 5 > 3:
	print("Indentation in Python is really important!")

# If we skip or don't make the indentation correctly Python will tell us that happen an error of syntax 
# The number of the indentation is up to the programmer, but must be the same in each space
# If the block of code is the same, must be in the same space


#### THIS IS A ERROR ####
# if 5 > 3:
# 	print("Indentation in Python is really important!")
# 		print("This is a error!")
